## Note - You can Visit the Online Deployed Version here - https://dpdzero-task.sahilnigam.online/
### Note - This is Just the Backend Repository for the Task - Feedback System. The Frontend Repository can be Found Here - https://github.com/Sahil2315/dpd-frontend-local
### Instead of having the Dockerfile inside the README.MD File (as Instructed) I have included it in the Directory for Convenience.
# Docker Related Setup Info - 
## First You need to Get the Git Repo to your machine - 
### Create a Directory for this Project named `backend`
### Get into that Directory (cd backend)
### Now Clone the GitHub Repo using `git clone https://github.com/Sahil2315/DPDZero-Task .`
### Now you pretty much have everything to get started
## Now, the Docker Part - You Need to Run the Following 2 Commands in order to properly run this backend app with Docker
### Note - Both of the Following commands would be run from outside the backend directory (run `cd ..` if you are inside the backend directory)
### `docker build -t fastapi-backend ./backend`
### `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-backend`

I hope I completed the Requirements of this Task and would be selected for Further Rounds of the Selection Process.
Thank you for your consideration.
